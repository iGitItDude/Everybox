# Welcome to Everybox!
You have found the most powerful emulation tool out there, which combines a bunch of emulators, so you don't have to download a bunch of apps that take up a bunch of space. We make it simpler to do some work, then reward yourself with some play. To get started, just go to the Releases tab if you're viewing this readme on GitHub or open the app if you already have the app.

# How does this work?
Do you know about all of the popular emulation software out there? Like every app, they're made of code, and to make this app, we took all of that code, improved it, and put the pieces of code into one software. That means, when you insert an N64 ROM into the Everybox, it runs the commands from Project 64, but saves your virtual N64 so you can use multiple N64 apps at once. However, when you insert an installation CD into the Everybox, all of the VirtualBox commands are run, which means you can have a virtual PC as well as a virtual N64, or even more combinations!

# How do you set this up?
Setting up a new virtual device is really easy, and there are two ways. The first way, and more intuitive way, is to drag and drop the file/device folder into the Everybox window. The app will recognise it, and open a new tab where you input the OS, version, title, description, and other options. Then press create and voila! You now have your very own virtual device! You can also set one up by clicking the + button, and then clicking what device you want, choosing the media you want the device to be based off of, and then following the same procedure as before.

# How do I get help?
If you need help, you can email me at dafundude1337@gmail.com and I will get back to you, or if you think what you "needed help on" was a bug, go the the Issues tab at the Everybox repo.
